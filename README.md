This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In addition to the vanilla setup from `create-react-app` I've used [React App Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) to tweak 2 things:
- SCSS is now enabled in conjunction with CSS Modules.
- SVG React Loader is enabled to allow treating svgs as components.
